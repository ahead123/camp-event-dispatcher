  <h1>Event Dispatcher JavaScript Exercise</h1>
  <p>An global event dispatcher has already been created </p>
  <p>And 2 handlers have been registered that will either change the background color or change the font color of this page.</p>
  <p>You can use the console to trigger an event in order to run the registered handlers</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the JavaScript console and enter the following commands:</li>
    <li>&gt; dispatcher.trigger("background", "blue") // To change the background color</li>
    <li>&gt; dispatcher.trigger("font", "yellow") // To change the font color</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once you implementation for the EventDispatcher is complete, triggering those events from the console will actually change the color of this page</p>
